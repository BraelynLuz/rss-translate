天里，三个团体与我接洽，询问我是否有兴趣加入一个财团竞标欧洲足球俱乐部。前景违反了我的两个核心投资原则：坚忍和无聊 >; 性感。我尽量保持冷静，避免投资具有性吸引力的东西（即听起来很酷的东西）。它们吸引了过多的资本，从而降低了回报。然而，我也认为我永远不会去游轮，我刚从游轮上回来。衰老改变你，我的中年危机想坐在我旁边的主人包厢里。</p><p>我并不孤单。体育特许经营权现在正掀起淘金热，买家涌入市场，估值也在上升。关于运动队市场的一些想法：</p><h4>非营利组织</h4><p>从历史上看，运动队的经济状况很糟糕。尽管是体育界最具标志性的资产之一，曼联去年损失了 1.16 亿英镑，前年损失了 9200 万英镑。有一段时间，布鲁克林篮网队每天损失 395,000 美元。这是有道理的：球队主要由超级富有的人所有，他们的竞争精神冲淡了建立财富的财政纪律。 （球队也是很好的<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/07/15/the-billionaire-playbook-how-sports-owners-use-their-teams-to-avoid-millions-in-taxes/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">避税场所</a>。）总而言之，运动队是第四任妻子俱乐部，本能、青春期的拘束和对死亡的恐惧在金钱的床上纵情狂欢。与第四次婚姻一样，<em>很多事情都</em>可能出错。这是运动：根据定义，每支球队都有机会……每次走上球场都会输。</p><p>一个多世纪以来，团队所有权一直是一个雷区。 1880 年，一位名叫 Christian von der Ahe 的酒馆老板购买了 St. Louis Brown Stockings。好几年之后，长袜队跌至联盟垫底，他们的体育场被烧毁，冯德阿赫的债权人<em>绑架了</em>他，他的妻子提出离婚。就在几年前，名人堂捕手<a href="https://theathletic.com/721275/2018/12/18/the-passion-of-mike-piazza-how-the-midlife-crisis-of-a-baseball-hall-of-famer-led-to-the-demise-of-a-100-year-old-italian-soccer-club/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">迈克·皮亚扎</a>斥资 1000 万美元买下一家意大利足球俱乐部，两年后破产，并在多次收到死亡威胁后离队。他还是结婚了。</p><p>然而……就像 Birkin 包、毕加索和大学学位一样，运动队的价值只是松散地与基本面联系在一起。最近这些价值已经上升。在过去十年中，MLB、NFL 和 NBA 球队的平均价值分别激增了 242%、303% 和 629%。 （标准普尔指数上涨 163%。） </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215259" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/avarge-teams.png" alt="" width="1000"

/></p><p></p><p>为什么团队经济学的河流倒转了方向？这是泡沫，还是基本面的转变将使价值的增长更持久？</p><h4>分分秒秒诞生</h4><p>与任何资产一样，运动队根据供需进行交易，而需求是渴望相关性的超级富豪数量的函数。体育特许经营权是可以想象的最炫耀性的消费。一辆好车和房子意味着你很富有。一架飞机让你变得有趣。拥有一支运动队会让你变得迷人。只有 550 人冒险进入外太空，大约是拥有大联盟球队大量股份的人数。专业提示：成为一名宇航员更令人印象深刻。尤其<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/jeff-bezos-is-not-my-astronaut/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">是真正的宇航员，如 Sally Ride</a> ，与私募股权亿万富翁的儿子相比。但我离题了。</p><p>正如加密货币和 SPAC 在短时间内受到<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">更大的傻瓜理论的</a>驱动一样，运动队也受到更大的死亡恐惧理论的驱动。一辆兰博基尼给贴身男仆留下了深刻印象；一支运动队给<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/05/kim-kardashian-tristan-thompson-lakers-playoffs.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">金姆</a>留下了深刻印象。并且有很多富人意识到生物学对他们的钱不感兴趣。所以他们把钱花在了他们的最后一顿饭上：运动队。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215260"

/></p><p></p><h4>大联盟</h4><p>即使我们造就了更多的亿万富翁，体育也为富人和组织提供了越来越“软”的回报。最重要的是需要清洗的财富。正如我们<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/the-mother-of-all-pivots/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">几周前所写</a>，海湾国家投入体育运动的资金数额惊人：卡塔尔在 2022 年世界杯上的花费比东道主在过去七届世界杯上花费的总和还多，而且它的上座率创下世界杯历史之最。 （顺便说一句，今年的法语和英语冠军将是<a href="https://dohanews.co/qatar-fully-acquires-french-football-club-psg/#:~:text=Qatari%20investors%20have%20now%20acquired%20full%20control%20of,now%20pass%20full%20ownership%20to%20the%20Qatari%20group."

rel="noopener">阿联酋</a>。）</p><p>网红文化的兴起和名气的货币化也增加了运动队对名人的价值，因为他们可以利用自己的品牌来推广球队。瑞安·雷诺兹 (Ryan Reynolds) 和罗伯·麦克尔亨尼 (Rob McElhenney) 的名人效应（配以<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65416090"

rel="noopener">奥斯汀足球俱乐部</a>在其第二年的美国职业足球大联盟中排名第二。</p><h4>树篱</h4><p>从流媒体到人工智能再到全球化，各种力量正在创造戏剧的领域：娱乐。在线广告很糟糕，电视广告更糟，65 岁以下的人从 40 岁起就再也没有听过广播广告。现场体育赛事不同：在体育赛事期间做广告的品牌仍然让人感觉被看到了——因为它们确实被看到了。运动对时移免疫；成为不想知道比分的人，因为“我为以后录制游戏”已经从烦人变成了徒劳。现场观众不能跳过广告，也不能忽视徽标、产品植入和冠名权。</p><p>结果不仅是收入增加，而且媒体中越来越缺乏的东西：<em>可靠的</em>收入。曾经，门票销售是主要收入来源，但转播权加上企业赞助扩大了支持这些组织的基础。曼联现在从转播交易中获得的收入是门票收入的两倍，在过去十年中，NFL、MLB 和 NBA 的年度赞助收入从 22 亿美元增长到 47 亿美元。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215263" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/manchaster-united.png" alt="" width="1000"

AI”，因为它不存在。真实的人类，占据相同的物理空间，在灯光下和线条之间，任何事情都可能发生——人类体验。从斗兽场到中世纪的比武，再到输家（有时是赢家）被牺牲的狂野阿兹特克球赛，体育运动始终具有在千篇一律的世界中独一无二的内在价值。没有什么比体育更能抵御技术颠覆了。</p><h4>垄断</h4><p>一个体面的投资主题是将资金投入不受监管的垄断企业。体育仍然像 19 世纪的信托一样运作，所有主要参数都在仔细的联合控制下，以保护现任者的回报。运动队是天然的垄断——球迷的忠诚度会阻止任何人在一个老牌球队附近开设一个竞争性的特许经营权——而联盟通过控制新球队可以启动的地方来加强这一点。自从 2002 年温布尔登球队搬到米尔顿凯恩斯并在其所在地成立了一家新俱乐部以来，英格兰就没有<a href="https://www.football-stadiums.co.uk/articles/newest-football-clubs/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">新的足球联赛俱乐部</a>。在此之前，最后一家真正的新俱乐部是 Burton Albion，成立于 1950 年。美国最高法院在很大程度上豁免了美国职棒大联盟的反托拉斯法，其他联盟也被允许在收入和薪水方面串通一气，从而影响其他行业的利益。监狱管理。</p><h4>金丝雀教授</h4><p>越来越清楚的是，我是商业媒体煤矿中的金丝雀。 Vice、Bloomberg Quicktake、CNN+ 和 BBC+ 都提供并开始制作以一位愤怒的教授为中心的电视节目。这些网络中至少有三个已经死亡。当网络过度投入时，他们会打电话给我，这意味着空气变得有害，你需要逃离矿井。同样，如果我被要求竞标运动队，我们可能会名列前茅。</p><h4>足球爸爸</h4><p>我小时候打过高尔夫球和足球。我想更接近我父亲，并给他留下深刻印象，而这正是他感兴趣的。我没有天生的足球天赋，但我成为了一名不错的高尔夫球手。大约 20 年前，我父亲年纪太大不能打高尔夫球，从那以后我大概打了三轮。给爸爸的专业提示：您的孩子不会继承您的兴趣——培养和采纳他们的兴趣是您的工作。事实上，我不太喜欢足球。但是我的儿子们喜欢它，所以我喜欢它。只有我们称之为足球。今天我和我 12 岁的孩子在后院打了两场比赛，这个星期天我将和两个儿子一起在酋长球场观看阿森纳对阵狼队的比赛。</p><p>我看比赛的次数不多，我记录的是激励我的孩子们的时刻。我观察他们的反应。我希望当他们有孩子时我还活着，这样我们就可以分享和讨论您对孩子的情感强度和范围。我唯一觉得“这就够了”的时候是和我的孩子们在一起的时候。足球提供了其中的一些时刻。他们称之为“美丽的游戏”。或许。显而易见的是，足球为我们提供了越来越稀缺的东西：一种鼓励男性表达情感并相互联系的亲身体验。许多人和组织正在花费数十亿美元来让自己感觉更年轻。没关系。我很感激，随着年龄的增长，享受着数十亿美元投资的一些投资回报率：我觉得和我的儿子们更亲近了。</p><p>生活如此丰富，

年代英国的全国矿工工会一样，错误地评估了形势，并将在严重受损的情况下退出罢工。</p><h4>煤炭</h4><p>矿工罢工和作家罢工之间存在着真正的区别。矿工罢工在工会内部引起了争议，一些地区拒绝参加。相比之下，作家协会以 98% 的票数支持这一行动。媒体正在奉承编剧，好莱坞明星也是如此。拥有数百万美元的演员为每集赚取 2,000 美元的<em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>作家提供咖啡真是太可爱了。 “我们和你站在一起……请不要碰我。”无论如何，差异不会产生影响。</p><p>这些团结都不重要，因为英国矿业和剧本娱乐有一个共同点：两者都处于结构性衰退中，并且在替代品海啸中处于错误的一端。英国煤炭产量在 1913 年达到顶峰，到 1970 年代，需求下降演变成崩溃。问题不在于缺乏煤炭——不列颠群岛坐落在 3 亿年前的碳化丛林中——而是消费者偏好的改变和过剩竞争。发电转向更清洁的北海天然气，即使进口煤炭的价格低于纽卡斯尔最好的价格。</p><p>情况非常糟糕，英国没收了这些矿山以维持它们的运转，因为这些矿场每年损失数亿英镑。促使罢工矿工最后对峙的是事关生死存亡的问题——计划关闭数十座矿山。他们尖叫着改变，但进步不听。 </p><p><img decoding="async"

年的编剧罢工催生）创造了一种对编剧依赖较少的完整类型。<em>警察</em>是最早的大型真人秀之一，被设想为可以在罢工期间制作的内容。</p><p>体育直播比以往任何时候都更受欢迎——2022 年<a

href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/apple-english-soccer-premier-league-1235307936/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">支付了</a>25 亿美元来播放美国职业足球大联盟，并且据传准备竞购英超联赛。还有更多精彩即将到来：MLS、XFL、WNBA、PLL、拉斯维加斯的曲棍球。即使在缩小的脚本电视类型中，也存在历史累积的竞争：2004 年的<em>老友记</em>，但 Netflix 在 2015 年支付了<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/03/20-somethings-streaming-friends-c-v-r.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">1.18 亿美元</a>无限流播所有 236 集。</p><p>最大的威胁不是其他电视……它不是电视。社交媒体的核心是即兴娱乐。 YouTube 每天有 1.22 亿美国用户，YouTuber MrBeast 的订阅用户是 Hulu 的三倍。但控制脚本电视风管的最大手属于 TikTok。由业余爱好者编写和制作的短视频以千兆字节充斥着我们的生活，其数量和种类无穷无尽——<a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">每天占据我们 95 分钟</a>的注意力。</p><p>观众越年轻，他们就越喜欢 TikTok 而不是电视。三分之二的 Z 世代被困在一个只有一个屏幕和 Wi-Fi 的荒岛上，他们表示他们会选择 TikTok 而不是整个电视和流媒体。换句话说，作家们不应该在洛杉矶的工作室外纠察，而应该在北京的字节跳动总部进行纠察。此外，罪魁祸首不是某个卡通反派工作室的高管，而是你的侄子，他从来没有用过有线电视，更喜欢花 45 分钟滚动 TikTok，而不是每月支付 6.99 美元来观看<em>《巫师》</em> 。他从未听说过斯蒂芬科尔伯特。 </p><p><img decoding="async"

周。而且流媒体在“剩余”方面向编剧支付很少或根本不支付——当节目进入重播和联合时收到的付款，曾经是不安全部门的巨大安全来源。制片厂也越来越依赖初级编剧，减少编剧的人数，并禁止编剧在其他剧中工作更长时间。十年前，三分之一的作家在所谓的“最低基本协议”下工作，这是制片厂必须支付的最低金额。今天做了一半。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone

Media 分析师 Mia Silverio 教授采访了纽约的一些纠察作家。他们向她保证，他们所做的，他们创造力的魔力，是一种明显的人类特征，不是人工智能可以复制的。不过，他们的工会并不像他们那样自信。谈判的症结之一是人工智能的使用。具体来说，工会希望禁止工作室使用它。虽然作者要求从内容中获取一种形式的残差来通知大型语言模型/生成 AI 是有道理的，但要求工作室不使用 AI 的成功概率与要求他们放弃短信和空调的成功概率相同。</p><p>与几乎每一项技术创新一样，人工智能会在短期内引发失业，然后在长期内创造净就业机会。自动化摧毁了工厂车间的工作岗位，但起初我们没有看到加热座椅和汽车音响会创造的工作岗位。流媒体业务中将出现大量利用人工智能的新服务提供商。此外，通常存在“胜者为王”的效应。一个体面的作家被剔除，一个伟大的作家赚得更多。总而言之，人工智能不会抢走你的工作，但懂人工智能的人会抢走你的工作。</p><p>专业提示：在罢工期间，让您的

One query I get often is “What class/skill would you suggest our kids take/learn to compete in the modern economy?” Or some-such. I think most expect me to say computer science, STEM courses, or some bullshit about the wonders of a liberal arts education that foments curiosity. But hands down, the skill I would grant my boys is singular: storytelling.</p><p> The arc of evolution <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12358" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">bends toward good storytellers</a> .

Storytellers themselves are more likely to receive acts of service from their peers — and among men, being skilled in storytelling <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pere.12120" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">increases attractiveness and perceived status</a> to potential long-term mates. My dad used to tell me that men get turned on with their eyes, women with their ears. It turns out his theory is backed by science.</p><p></p><h4> Narrative vs. Numbers</h4><p> Data may be more truthful, but in the battle between narrative and numbers, most of the time humanity picks narrative. Among CEOs, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/10/13/three-reasons-storytelling-is-critical-to-success-in-data-and-analytics/?sh=595f8fe1176c" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">7 in 10</a> sometimes ignore data insights in favor of “trusting their gut.” More potent than statistics in cancer awareness campaigns are personal narratives — advertisers know this and have unleashed the power of stories to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13187-019-01521-6" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">increase cancer screening rates</a> .</p><p> Social change follows the narrative. The meatpacking industry famously registered structural upheaval not in response to data on worker conditions, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/upton-sinclair-meat-industry" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Upton Sinclair&#39;s novel</a> <em>The Jungle</em> . Today, attitudes towards gay and trans people are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318863032_More_than_a_Media_Moment_The_Influence_of_Televised_Storylines_on_Viewers'_Attitudes_toward_Transgender_People_and_Policies" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">softening</a> in many communities thanks to personal stories in television and other media — and the right is weaponizing this, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/trans-people-right-wing-media" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">creating</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/politics/transgender-conservative-campaign.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">hysteria</a> about a supposed plague of boys playing girls sports and using their bathrooms to harden those attitudes and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-is-the-gop-escalating-attacks-on-trans-rights-experts-say-the-goal-is-to-make-sure-evangelicals-vote" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">whip</a> up the base. Social media algorithms, at their core, connect bursts of media (scenes) into a story. But they&#39;ve learned that the stories we can&#39;t look away from are often those that validate our anxiety and depression, that confirm our suspicion that other people are awful.</p><h4> Story Inc.</h4><p> Storytelling has flourished, becoming a large and profitable industry. In Hollywood, a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-02/hollywoods-writers-have-gone-on-strike-heres-five-things-you-need-to-know" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">disagreement</a> between the storytellers and their corporate employers over how to divide those profits has taken late-night talk shows off the air, threatens the continuation of hundreds of television shows, and imperils swathes of the Southern California economy. Also, it&#39;s producing some excellent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/04/1173991667/wga-writers-strike-best-signs" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">picket signs</a> . Like everything else, this is partly an AI story — one of the points of contention is how to manage AI&#39;s role in writing. Video games have evolved from bouncing pixels off one another into a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/gaming-pandemic-lockdowns-pwc-growth/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$250 billion</a> industry dependent on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/04/us/zelda-nintendo-history.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">stories</a> that sprawl across dozens of games, and are pored over and loved by generations of players.</p><p> Companies are defined by their stories, which can shape their economic output. Public relations is a <a href="https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/public-relations-global-market-report" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$100 billion-per-year</a> industry, and growing. Amazon employs 1,900 in its PR and communications division. That&#39;s almost double the number of journalists at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/business/media/washington-post-jeff-bezos-revenue.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">paper their boss owns</a> . Across Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft there are now almost as many PR/comms employees as there are screenwriters in America. However, they don&#39;t need to strike, as they&#39;re paid a shit-ton. Sheryl Sandberg was paid <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2022/06/02/billionaire-sheryl-sandberg-has-unloaded-more-than-90-of-her-facebook-stock-over-the-past-decade/?sh=1fabfe515889" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion</a> to tell stories of gender equality and personal loss to distract from the stories her algorithms were telling our teens.</p><p> Elon Musk built the ninth-most-valuable company in the world not because he knew anything about electric cars, but because he&#39;s a master storyteller who inspired a team of world-class engineers to build a better one. I don&#39;t like Musk, but I&#39;d still rather have dinner with him than Mary Barra. The previous sentence is not true, but it fits my narrative. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215215" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart-.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart-.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart--300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart--520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart--768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart--1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bar-chart--1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> I got my start building companies, telling stories. Later I became a professor, where the students pay $170,000 in tuition for me to deliver a three-hour lullaby. Note: My agent (NYU) takes a 97% commission. Now I tell stories on a stage in front of 150 to 15,000 people who pay between $100,000 to $250,000 to see if I can weave my observations about tech, society, economics, and fatherhood into a story. <span style="font-weight: 400;">And</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">my largest source of wealth creation has been pre-IPO stock, awarded in exchange for helping CEOs craft a story they can tell institutional investors.</span> Like most skills, storytelling is an amalgam of nature and nurture.</p><h4> Nature</h4><p> My dad says he&#39;s been married/divorced four times. It&#39;s probably 5 or 6 — he&#39;s that kind of guy. A strong jawline and mesmeric storytelling, wrapped in Glaswegian elocution. At any gathering, my father manages to draw a circle of people around him who listen to stories of his upbringing in Depression-era Scotland, peppered with jokes that are impossible not to laugh at. In &#39;70s California this meant my dad could not only think with his dick, but also listen to it. He left us when I was 8, and I resented him a great deal. Not so much for not being there for me — he tried. But for how callous he was to my mom. It was difficult to embrace someone when the most important person in my life (my mom) viewed him as her enemy.</p><p> What made it easier was recognizing that my ability to take my sons to the World Cup, and take care of the woman he left, comes (somewhat) from my dad being my dad. There&#39;s no getting around it: I inherited some of his gift — and for the past 30 years I&#39;ve made my living off of it. I also inherited a bunch of his shittier qualities, but that&#39;s another post.</p><h4> Nurture</h4><p> There are ways to get better. Some thoughts on learning to fly, and telling good stories.</p><p> <strong>Listen:</strong> Good communication starts with the message, which comes from knowledge and observation. In part, this means listening to others: read widely and ask questions. But more important: Listen to yourself. Cultivate an internal voice that tells you what&#39;s flawed or missing in the popular discourse. People prefer a counter-narrative. Be the hunter who tracks straight to where the prey is actually hiding.</p><p> <strong>Evaluate:</strong> Stress-test your ideas against available data, either in conversation or by writing it out. Science rests on this process — the “scientific method” of developing a falsifiable hypothesis, then conducting experiments to prove or disprove it. By the time I give a talk on a corporate campus in Redmond or a cruise ship (next week: Summit at Sea), 10-plus people will have touched/listened to/fact-checked/designed the deck, often in groups. Most of the concepts we consider for this newsletter or my talks never see the light of day, exiled by data and other folks who make me seem (much) smarter than I am and save me from myself. Something I wish I&#39;d recognized earlier: Greatness is in the agency of others.</p><p> <strong>Frame:</strong> This is where innovation melds with communication. You have an idea you understand and believe in, but how do you express it in a compelling manner? Try things out. I&#39;ve had success with extended metaphors, personal anecdotes, and presenting information visually. As I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve started to embrace the personal. It comes easily, as I&#39;m a narcissist. But also, people are looking for a connection, and a good way to connect with several hundred strangers at once (or with just one person) is to be vulnerable. Making people feel something bests any business insight. In a remote world swamped by a tsunami of digital information, the rare earth metal is humanity.</p><p> <strong>Be Fearless:</strong> The fear is real, and it can end the game before it starts. People say it&#39;s fear of speaking. I think it&#39;s more than this — it&#39;s fear of rejection. The fear that someone will validate your insecurities and rebuff your advances, be it initiating a conversation or presenting an idea. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215216" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dounut-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> However, the willingness to subject yourself to rejection is like sleep: Without it, you can&#39;t succeed. I believe there are two main sources for my courage to get onstage and say provocative things: My mother, who showed me she loved me every day of my childhood; and my atheism, knowing that my relationships with the people I love and who let me love them — they are the only things that really matter.</p><p> My 15-year-old son has mostly gone mute, as he&#39;s decided everything and everyone is unfathomably uncool. I ask (demand) that he start a conversation when we&#39;re together or at the dinner table. My 12-year-old is a terrorist at home, but painfully shy in public. I demand — and he hates this — that he speak to strangers when we&#39;re out of the house. On Sunday we ventured to the Battersea Power Station mall, which was awesome, and I told him to speak to the guy staffing the help desk and shape our plan for attacking the mall. Not exactly a TED talk … give it time.</p><p> <strong>Deliver:</strong> Once you know what to say, say it. Embrace an economy of words. Ask yourself, “How can we say this visually?” Brevity makes things easier to understand and signals directionality and confidence. It demonstrates that you are actually <em>saying something</em> . Think of the last several emails you wrote. The length and formality of the email is inversely correlated to your comfort with that person. My presentations are often 150 slides long, but I (try to) circumnavigate tech and society in 60 minutes. I assume the listener knows a lot and likes me, and I like them … so we can get right to the point. We&#39;re friends.</p><h4> Kids</h4><p> What I want most for my two sons is not that they become Nobel prize winners or members of Congress, but that they live rewarding lives full of meaningful relationships. And that they are good citizens. Most of that&#39;s on them. Parents tell themselves a story that kids are blocks of clay we mold. Pro tip: They come to you not fully formed but in roughly their own shape. We&#39;re not engineers, but shepherds. In our limited time as their shepherd, we can arm them with skills that increase their prospects for success. Learning math, going to college, landing a job — all powerful tools. But the weapon of mass attraction is the ability to communicate. I wish I&#39;d figured this out earlier: Money, mates, and meaning are all moths to the flame of storytelling.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week I discussed the loneliness epidemic with US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy on the Prof G Pod. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4t6eUNjxcT10LvzfCNi69d" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Listen here</a> .</p><p> PPS <a href="https://www.sectionschool.com/companies/for-companies?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=nmnm&amp;utm_campaign=enterprise&amp;utm_content=0505#request-a-demo" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Bring your team to sprint with me</a> in May.

But that&#39;s not what this post is about.</p><p> A “pivot” is a strategic change in business model, direction, or target market. Think Netflix&#39;s shift from DVDs to streaming, Adobe&#39;s move to subscription, or Amazon&#39;s launch of AWS. Sounds easy, but real transitions require a staggering investment and a leap of faith that make shareholders queasy. And, most of the time, they don&#39;t work. Meta&#39;s stock doubling in the last six months is a function of the market&#39;s belief that The Zuck is waking up from his Big Gulp, Venti Grande Ayahuasca hallucination re a $20 billion-per-year investment in the metaverse. Meta&#39;s earnings this week revealed Reality Labs (its opium den posing as a business unit) saw revenue decline to $350 million while losing $4 billion in the last 3 months. This means the birth control known as Oculus is pacing to lose the combined profits of Honda, BMW, and General Motors in &#39;23.</p><p> These bets are dwarfed by the greatest redirect in economic history: The Gulf States&#39; attempt to pivot from oil-based economies to something more sustainable.</p><h4> Party&#39;s Over</h4><p> For the past century, the Gulf States have run on oil — and still do. State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco is now more valuable than the next 10 largest energy companies combined, and last year it booked $161 billion in <em>profits</em> — likely the largest net income figure ever recorded. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215212" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1250" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart-300x195.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart-520x339.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart-768x500.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart-1536x1000.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tree-chart-1200x781.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> Only, there&#39;s a catch. The well is running dry. Regardless of the cadence of the move to renewables, the battery running the Gulf EV goes dead some time this century. Data re the oil remaining under the sand are closely guarded state secrets for the Gulf nations. But Bahrain is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/economic-diversification-in-the-gulf-time-to-redouble-efforts/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">expected</a> to run out within the decade, Oman in two decades, and the Kingdom by the end of the century, possibly sooner.</p><p> The plan to redirect this wealth into something else is unprecedented: building a next-generation civilization from scratch. Scratch, plus a few trillion dollars.</p><h4> Its Own Moon</h4><p> The scale and boldness of this bet is peerless. Let&#39;s start with a 105-mile-long glass-domed mega-city in the desert to house 9 million people with no cars, staffed by robots, and powered entirely by wind and solar. Oh, and it will have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CapKv6SPRZF/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">ski resort</a> . And its own moon.</p><p> This sci-fi mega-city is the centerpiece of Saudi Arabia&#39;s Neom project, budgeted at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/neom-saudi-arabia-pushes-ahead-with-its-sci-fi-city-vision.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$500 billion</a> . Keep in mind, that&#39;s the budget — and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2424835" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">9 out of 10</a> mega-projects go over budget. Saudi Arabia is also building the Diriyah Gate, a <a href="http://www.tradearabia.com/news/CONS_400332.html#:~:text=RIYADH%2C%20September%206%2C%202022,real%20estate%20consultancy%20Knight%20Frank." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$20 billion property development</a> that will add 20,000 homes to the historic district of Diriyah, and the Red Sea Project, which will build <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/travel-hospitality/inside-saudi-arabias-red-sea-global-everything-you-need-to-know" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">1,000 homes and 50 hotels</a> across 22 small islands. Meanwhile, Qatar is building its own <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/lusail-qatar/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“city of the future”</a> fit with a 90,000-capacity sports stadium, a dedicated entertainment district (“Entertainment City”), and the country&#39;s first six-star hotel. No ski resort, though. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215209" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1120" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart-300x175.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart-520x303.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart-768x448.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart-1536x896.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bar-chart-1200x700.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Bait</h4><p> The secret sauce in the Gulf State pivot isn&#39;t the oil money itself, however. That&#39;s the bait. The prize is other people&#39;s money. Specifically, rich people&#39;s money. The plan, distilled, is to become the global headquarters for the mega-wealthy. This strategy increasingly makes sense as wealthy people continue to weaponize even democratic governments whose policies crowd more of the spoils into the top .01%.</p><p> The best way to attract the rich is to give them what they want. Which in 2023 means three things: luxury hospitality, world-class entertainment, and low taxes. The Gulf has gone all-in on all three.</p><p> The Saudis have launched their own ultra-luxury hotel brand, the <a href="https://www.timeoutriyadh.com/hotels/the-boutique-group" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Boutique Group</a> , and Qatar owns <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/07/05/qatar-plaza-hotel/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">The Plaza Hotel</a> in New York and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/qatari-fund-buys-lloyds-s-stake-in-london-s-savoy-hotel" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">The Savoy</a> in London. (Pro-tip: These weren&#39;t property or even hotel acquisitions but brand acquisitions.) The United Arab Emirates built the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Al_Arab" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Burj Al Arab</a> and has its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emirates_Academy_of_Hospitality_Management" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">luxury hospitality university</a> . Ever fly Emirates, Etihad, or Qatar airlines? (Think in-air shower spa.)</p><p> Middle Eastern interests now own many of the world&#39;s most iconic football clubs, including Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, and Newcastle United. Qatar spent $220 billion on the FIFA World Cup (more than the last seven World Cups combined), and many critics accused it of “sportswashing” — using love of sports to distract from its human-rights record. And sportswash it did: The Qatar World Cup had the <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/sports/2022/12/04/FIFA-World-Cup-2022-Qatar-records-highest-ever-attendance-in-tournament-s-history" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">highest-ever attendance</a> in the tournament&#39;s history, as well as <a href="https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/news/one-month-on-5-billion-engaged-with-the-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">one-fifth</a> of the world population watching the final.

They&#39;ve also pledged billions of dollars toward finding the <a href="https://www.agbi.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invests-in-art-to-create-the-arab-damien-hirst/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“Arab Damien Hirst.”</a> The Emiratis are building a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/01/28/business/abu-dhabi-art-of-building-louvre-guggenheim-saadiyat/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$27 billion</a> culture center on Saadiyat Island featuring the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Jean Nouvel-designed Louvre Abu Dhabi, and Qatar commissioned Nouvel to design its <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/national-museum-of-qatar" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$434 million</a> National Museum of Qatar.</p><p> Marketing for these mega-projects is multipronged and not always subtle. Last year, my 12-year-old emerged from a YouTube K-hole and said, “Dad, did you know you can stay in a hotel that&#39;s in the biggest building in the world?” That didn&#39;t sound that great to me, but it did to him — and sure enough, we stayed at the Armani Hotel in the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, on our World Cup tour of the region. We have been to the Gulf three times in the last six months.</p><p> The Middle East is a museum of superlative landmarks, the branding brash and effective. Dubai has the tallest Ferris wheel, Jeddah&#39;s F1 track is the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.first-look-fastest-ever-f1-street-circuit-revealed-for-saudi-arabian-grand.3DlnO9gJaDmaGJtpWnBLHR.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">fastest</a> , and after the race, your family of four can drop $2,200 on a lovely but unremarkable dinner at the world&#39;s most expensive Greek restaurant (Nammos). My dad didn&#39;t speak to me for two days when I ordered a $3.25 malt shake at the Lahaina Baskin &amp; Robbins in 1977.</p><p> The final puzzle piece: taxes. Or lack thereof. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar have some of the world&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/finance/the-18-countries-with-the-lowest-tax-rates-in-the-world/slidelist/49243341.cms" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">lowest tax rates</a> . Similar to what <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37751599?msclkid=73c04bd2a62411ec83e2d3124a2201bc" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">London did</a> 30 years ago, Dubai is committed to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-01/dubai-is-newest-hedge-fund-hub-as-millennium-exoduspoint-move-in" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">deregulating</a> its financial sector. The city is drawing in new firms with reduced licensing fees and capital requirements for hedge funds that domicile there. And the UAE is attracting wealthy Russians with its bold position on the war in Ukraine: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-26/uae-abstained-in-un-vote-on-ukraine-to-put-emphasis-on-diplomacy" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">neutral</a> .</p><h4> Hard Power</h4><p> Speaking of … the only thing that bests soft power is hard power — the ability to deliver violence abroad known as military spending. The Kingdom&#39;s military expenditures reached <a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2023/world-military-expenditure-reaches-new-record-high-european-spending-surges" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$75 billion</a> last year, the fifth highest in the world, and more than any nation in Europe except Russia. Big military spenders either invade nations (Iraq, Ukraine) or have the world on tenterhooks guessing where they will invade (Taiwan). To believe Saudi won&#39;t flex its power is naive.</p><p> Back to the big shiny stuff they&#39;re building. ……</p><h4> The Elephant in the Private Zoo</h4><p> What&#39;s not to like about this plan? The sheer audacity is notable. But the Gulf nations have experience with massive projects — you don&#39;t pump 13 million barrels a day without knowing how to build — and a deep appreciation for outside experts. They are recruiting, from the four corners of the Earth, people and small firms that range from banks to ad agencies, paying them multiples of what they can make at home, and asking them to build the future. It&#39;s not without huge issues. Some of those Western experts have quit; according to the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/expatriate-executives-flee-saudi-arabias-bad-bosses-crown-prince-mohammed-mbs-neom-nasr-11654008823?st=luwl1g23b9e78ap&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em> , Neom CEO Nadhmi al-Nasr is on tape telling underlings in a meeting, “I drive everybody like a slave. When they drop down dead, I celebrate.”</p><p> Western consultants being overworked is not what gives us pause about this vision. Al-Nasr&#39;s reference to workers dropping dead was <em>probably</em> meant metaphorically, only it&#39;s not just strong language — we don&#39;t know how many migrant workers died building the World Cup venues in Qatar, but the Qataris have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/world-cup-2022-how-many-migrant-workers-have-died-qatar-2022-11-24/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">admitted</a> to over 400. And there&#39;s no escaping that the Gulf nations hold a different view of personal liberty than the West. On some levels, this is easy to address, and these envisioned cities will enjoy some additional liberties. Alcohol will be widely available, there won&#39;t be dress codes, and there are signals of an increasing tolerance for people&#39;s religious and sexual preferences that isn&#39;t enjoyed elsewhere in most Gulf nations. We&#39;ll see. The track record isn&#39;t great.</p><p> The concerns become dystopian fast. Neom will be run by an operating system called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neom-saudi-smart-city-data-surveillance-plans-experts-2021-3" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Neos</a> , and every resident will have a unique ID number, with 24/7 tracking. No need to carry keys, since Neos will know which doors you are supposed to be able to open. No need to carry money; Neos can put it on your tab. No need for Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s security apparatus to hack your phone to listen in on all your conversations, either.</p><h4> If You Build It, They Will Come</h4><p> Will rich people want to live in a future built by the same people who murdered a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">journalist</a> ? The sober answer is yes. People care about human rights. However, most people, most of the time, care more about their prosperity even if it comes at the expense of others. Think Big Tech.</p><p> The early indications are that using money to attract money … works. The Gulf has become a premier destination for fundraising efforts. In just the past few weeks, venture firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and IVP have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/567ca518-b138-4273-bfe6-0712ef31e01d" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">held high-profile events in</a> the Gulf. “The Four Seasons in Riyadh,” according to one prominent venture partner, “is basically Palo Alto.” An executive in the UAE&#39;s investment company <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/567ca518-b138-4273-bfe6-0712ef31e01d" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">said</a> , “We came to San Francisco looking for them in 2017. Now everyone is coming to us.”</p><p> Some are coming to stay. Ray Dalio is setting up a branch of his family office in Dubai, and big-name hedge funds, including Millennium, ExodusPoint, and BlueCrest, all have offices in the Gulf already. The UAE registered a net inflow of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-01/dubai-is-newest-hedge-fund-hub-as-millennium-exoduspoint-move-in" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">4,000 millionaires</a> in 2022, and in Dubai, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-16/russian-buyers-help-to-propel-dubai-s-property-sales-to-record?sref=mNrqRJq9" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$57 billion</a> in real estate changed hands, up 80% from 2021, including 86,000 residential properties and 219 homes worth over $10 million.</p><p> There is merit to the suggestion that a decent strategy for success is to find the largest pile of money and stand as close to it as possible. The largest pile can now be seen from all continents, and millions will migrate. Does this represent a subjugation of Western values to money or the realization that capitalism&#39;s self-interest is the premier force in a modern world? The answer is yes. Strategy is leveraging your strengths to do something that is really hard, ideally impossible for others. The Kingdom&#39;s strengths are unprecedented capital and a willingness to play the long game. So, how does this impact you? Nothing draws human capital like capital. If you live in the West or South Asia, one of your kids may well end up in the Gulf. Is this good or bad?我不知道。 It just … is.

The perpetrator? Not an extremist group or criminal network, but someone we&#39;re more familiar with. A young man who spends too much time online.</p><p> Technology and our inability to regulate it have again made things worse. Much worse. The leaker&#39;s preferred platform was Discord, which has been used to share <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/waynesboro-man-23-headed-prison-203904081.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">child pornography</a> and coordinate the white supremacist riots in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlottesville-trial-aims-to-show-unite-the-right-organizers-planned-violence-11635163200?mod=article_inline" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Charlottesville</a> . Discord is not alone. Recently, Instagram <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/25/facebook-frances-haugen-molly-russell-teen-suicide-social-media-uk/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">assisted the suicide</a> of a young British girl by serving her images of nooses and razor blades. Facebook fueled a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-facebooks-rise-fueled-chaos-and-confusion-in-myanmar/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">mob riot</a> in Myanmar. The list goes on: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/16/1157180971/10-things-to-know-about-how-social-media-affects-teens-brains" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Teen depression</a> ,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmr.10.0353" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">viral misinformation</a> , widespread <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/30/partisan-divides-in-media-trust-widen-driven-by-a-decline-among-republicans/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">distrust</a> of national institutions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGQod8NQlz0" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">polarization</a> , algorithms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">optimized</a> for rage and radicalization … <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/emissions/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">We&#39;ve discussed this before</a> .</p><p> What&#39;s startling about this latest scandal is the banality. A reckless young man trying to gain social status online accidentally shapes world events. Steve Jobs called computers “bicycles for the mind” because they amplify our capabilities dramatically. It&#39;s a nice image. A more apt analogy for many young men, however, is a Kawasaki H2 Mach IV, a motorcycle that possessed far too much power and had a rear-biased weight balance that made it an accident waiting to happen. Too much power, not enough balance, and injury is inevitable. Tech has become a bullet bike, a reliable source of disturbing accidents and organ donations.</p><h4> Stupid Proof</h4><p> People have always been stupid, and everyone is stupid some of the time. (Note: Professor Cipolla&#39;s <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/big-stupid/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">definition</a> is people whose actions are destructive to themselves and to others.) One of society&#39;s functions is to prevent a tragedy of the commons by building safeguards to protect us from our own stupidity. We usually call this “regulation,” a word Reagan and Thatcher made synonymous with bureaucrats and red tape. Yes, Air Traffic Control delays and the DMV are super annoying, but not crashing into another A-350 on approach to Heathrow, not suffocating as your throat swells from an allergic reaction, and being able to access the funds in your FTX account are all really awesome.</p><p> Sixty years ago the US registered more than 50,000 car crash deaths annually. So we created the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and charged it with making the roads safer. If you&#39;re under 60, this may be hard to imagine, but not that long ago, many Americans saw seat belts as an assault on their personal liberty — some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/when-americans-went-to-war-against-seat-belts-2020-5" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">cut them</a> out of their cars. Democracy bested stupidity, however, and between 1966 and 2021, vehicular death rates in America were halved. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215197" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1100" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-1-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> The NHTSA is one of the many boring state and federal agencies critical to a healthy society. Before the Food and Drug Administration, the sale and distribution of food and pharmaceuticals was a free-for-all. The Federal Aviation Administration is the reason your chances of dying in a plane crash are <a href="https://flyfright.com/statistics/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">1 in 3.37 billion</a> . Next time someone tells you they don&#39;t trust government, ask them if they trust cars, food, pain killers, buildings, or airplanes.</p><p> The limits on innovation imposed by these agencies — their red tape — are real, and worth it. Millions of us are alive and prospering because we had the foresight and discipline to blunt the sharp end of industrial progress with the guardrails of democratic oversight. Until you open your phone …</p><h4> Exempt</h4><p> The greatest anomaly in the history of US regulation is the place more and more of us spend most of our time: online. A lethal cocktail of complexity, lobbying, cultural worship of tech leaders, and anti-government libertarian screed has rendered tech immune to the basic standards of safety and protection. Lethal is the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/25/facebook-frances-haugen-molly-russell-teen-suicide-social-media-uk/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">correct term</a> . Tech comes into the purview of other agencies on occasion. (Though it&#39;s always bitching it&#39;s special and shouldn&#39;t be restrained by the olds at the FTC and DOJ.) And the industry&#39;s blocking efforts have been effective. There is no FDA or SEC for tech, which is America&#39;s largest sector by market capitalization and growing. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215195" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donunt-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> The justification for this was the go-to new-economy get-out-of-jail-free word: “innovation.” When tech was nascent and niche, we were smart to err on the side of growth vs. regulation. That movie ended a decade ago. Phones aren&#39;t toys for early adopters, and search and social have moved beyond campuses. We don&#39;t require a license to drive a Big Wheel, but if a Big Wheel 5G went 750 miles per hour we might restrict access, or at least demand airbags.</p><p> The go-to narrative for these platforms after every new disaster is the delusion of complexity. And that the Internet is just another communications technology (eg, the phone, a letter), a reflection of society, and it would be near-impossible to put guardrails in place. Also, sprinkle in some blather re free speech. This is all bullshit. AI can write a <em>Seinfeld</em> script in the voice of Shakespeare. It can scan platforms for words and images associated with risks — they&#39;re already doing it for signals you might be shopping for Crocs. But what&#39;s the incentive for a platform to make the investment in any editorial review? Other than decency and regard for others, that is?</p><p> We&#39;ve done a good job stupid-proofing the offline world, but that&#39;s increasingly not where we live, especially younger people who now spend roughly the <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-02-14%20-%20Testimony%20-%20Prinstein.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">same amount of time online as they do sleeping</a> . They (we) pass the majority of our waking hours riding in a vehicle with no airbags, licenses, or traffic lights. Plus, there are millions of autonomous vehicles on the road controlled by unknown actors, and they&#39;re prone to running over pedestrians.</p><h4> Operation Pause</h4><p> Tech is embarking on its next big adventure: artificial intelligence. Which likely means rapid innovation, increased productivity, and another tsunami of unforeseen societal harms. Predicting how AI will tear the fabric of civilization is the new bingo. Humanoid phishing scams that access bank accounts, AI-generated “camera footage” and headlines that make the truth increasingly opaque, rogue AI gods determined to eradicate humanity. Experts agree: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/large-language-models-artificial-intelligence/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">All</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/technology/ai-chatbots-disinformation.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-12/artificial-intelligence-ai-scams-voice-cloning-phishing-chatgpt/102064086" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">this</a> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/google-chief-ominous-warning-ai-065047768.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">is</a> <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ai-threatens-humanity-expert-quotes/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">possible</a> .</p><p> What&#39;s telling is the technologists&#39; collective reaction to their own creation. For the first time, they want to slow down. A few weeks ago they wrote a petition calling on AI labs to <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“immediately pause”</a> all training of the most powerful AI models for six months — hundreds of tech leaders signed the letter. The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, who started the hype spiral with ChatGPT, says he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/17/openai-sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-warning-gpt4" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“scared”</a> of his company&#39;s own algorithms. One AI expert said the six-month moratorium isn&#39;t harsh enough; instead, he says, <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“shut it all down.”</a> What undermined the veracity of the letter was one signatory, Elon Musk, who&#39;s asked others to pause as he fast-tracks his <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musk-says-he-is-working-on-his-own-ai-chatbot-called-truthgpt/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">own AI programs</a> . (As usual, he&#39;s full of shit.)</p><h4> Both Hands</h4><p> We should grab this opportunity with both hands. Specifically, both hands on the wheel. Not a “pause,” which, in my view, is a bad idea. (China, Russia, and North Korea won&#39;t pause.) If the guy who just <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/tech/twitter-verification-blue-check-purge/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">disappeared</a> my blue check hadn&#39;t been kicked out of OpenAI, and controlled it instead, do you believe he&#39;d be advocating for a pause? Better idea: The 78 podcasts that garner more downloads than the <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/ProfGPod?sid=newsletter" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Pod</a> should suspend their programming. You know … just to get our arms around this new, and potentially dangerous, podcast medium.</p><p> But we do need to seize this moment, likely brief, when some tech leaders have remembered the virtues of government oversight. We need a serious, sustained, and centralized effort at the federal level, perhaps a new cabinet-level agency, to take the lead in regulating … we can call it AI, because pretty soon AI will be everywhere in tech.</p><p> There have been efforts at comprehensive technology regulation we can pick up and carry across the finish line. For example, last year Senator Michael Bennet proposed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4201" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Digital Platform Commission Act</a> , which would create a federal body to “provide reasonable oversight and regulation of digital platforms.” In other words: Exactly what we&#39;re talking about. But it&#39;s still stuck at the “introduced” stage. As with any political issue, it needs public support.</p><p> What won&#39;t work is fake regulation — when the government issues broad, vague statements about what companies should generally do. That&#39;s what Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">did with crypto</a> , and he&#39;s doing it again with AI. Specifically, his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,”</a> which is filled with truisms, platitudes, and no laws. Similarly, the NIST published its <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“AI Risk Management Framework.”</a> Again, not laws.</p><h4> Psychotics and the Homeless</h4><p> Earlier this month, a tech executive was tragically stabbed and died. Outspoken members of the tech industry immediately speculated the killer was a <a href="https://californialocal.com/localnews/statewide/ca/article/show/34672-crime-out-control-san-francisco-bob-lee-california/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“psychotic homeless person.”</a> A few days later, an acquaintance of the victim (also a <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/nima-momeni-suspect-bob-lee-killing/3204977/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">tech entrepreneur</a> ) was arrested and charged. Note: The homeless are <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hau-chg-mythsfacts-12-8-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more</a> <a href="https://californialocal.com/localnews/statewide/ca/article/show/6215-homelessness-crime-california/">likely</a> to be victims of crime than perpetrators.</p><p> The above is another variation on a story told repeatedly across an innovation economy where we have incorrectly conflated wealth and innovation with character. A growing vein of the tech community (<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/venture-catastrophists/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Venture Catastrophists</a> ) deploy weapons of mass distraction and fear to wallpaper over an inconvenient truth: The menace unleashed on America the past two decades isn&#39;t psychotic homeless people or a crime wave, but a tech community whose products depress our teens, polarize our public and render our discourse more coarse … making it less likely we come together and address issues including homelessness and crime. Our failure to regulate this sector, as we have done with every other sector, is stupid.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/ProfGPod?sid=newsletter" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Pod</a> I spoke with Stephen Dubner, host of the Freakonomics Radio podcast.

So I&#39;d rather focus on scarves. Specifically, Hermès, the iconic luxury brand. With $12 billion in annual revenue, Hermès now has a larger market capitalization than … Nike, which boasts $47 billion in annual revenue. I see this as a slow, yet tectonic, shift in consumer values (cue dramatic music) as awareness cedes ground to artisanship. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215189" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1100" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> Awareness, via social platforms, has created a generation of empty-calorie brands — Kylie Cosmetics, Dollar Shave Club, Andrew Tate — built on sand. Over the past five years, the three biggest consumer packaged goods companies (P&amp;G, Nestlé, and Unilever) whose competence is (building) awareness, have averaged annual stock gains of 9%, vs. 15% for the three largest luxury firms (LVMH, Kering, and Estée Lauder).</p><p> The decline of linear TV is a function of cable TV losing its oligopoly on awareness and awareness beginning to lose value as brands famous for being famous are less enduring. This trend highlights what has got to be a first-ballot-hall-of-fame strategic head-up-your-ass decision: Do away with one of the great artisanal brands of the 20th century, HBO. But that&#39;s not what this post is about.</p><p> Key to artisanship is there being few artisans. Specifically, the existence of scarcity. Or, as is often the case, the illusion of scarcity. The strongest brands in the world — MIT, Apple, Hermès, the US — are built on the artificial choking of supply via rejectionist admissions, pricing strategies, production, and visas.</p><p> Thirteen years ago I started a business intelligence firm that advised luxury (then CPG) brands. It was a successful company, predicated on a simple premise: Luxury brands would trade at higher multiples of revenue due to increasing income inequality and their ability to manufacture scarcity. That was the sermon I preached to every executive we met. We sold the company in 2017 for 8x revenue. Mirroring our client base, we were disciplined about pricing and said no to a lot of potential clients&#39; procurement departments (BTW, awful job). My first consulting firm, Prophet, had said yes to every client with a checkbook, and it sold for 2.8x revenue. It was the right decision at the time, as I didn&#39;t have the capital to utter the sexiest word in the English language: no.</p><h4> Want vs. Need</h4><p> The richest man in the world doesn&#39;t make cars, rockets, or enterprise software — he makes handbags. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LVMH" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">LVMH</a> , is now worth more than Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg combined. He&#39;s made his fortune not selling things people need, but things they want. LVMH controls the most prestigious luxury brands in the world, from Tiffany &amp; Co. to Loro Piana to Louis Vuitton.</p><p> When you assemble artisans and create scarcity that results in a supply/demand imbalance, you generate a cash volcano that you can cap the same way you do an oil well — and turn on/off as needed. Businesses are either supply-constrained (eg, rare earth minerals, 1945 Château Mouton wine, etc.) or demand-constrained (pretty much everything else). The companies that trade at the greatest multiples are those that are artificially supply-constrained, where the supply/demand imbalance puts a dial on the spigot the managers control. Imagine the decision to have more revenue is just a function of when you&#39;d like more revenue (see above: Hermès).</p><p> I wrote about scarcity six years ago. How to create it, how to sell it … why it&#39;s so important. Today, scarcity is more important — and scarce — than ever. In sum, this post still resonates.</p><hr /><p> [The following was originally published on March 3, 2017.]</p><p> Scarcity is key to irrational prices. Beachfront property is scarce and, regardless of the economic cycle, always in demand. You can also manufacture scarcity with similar results (crazy-town prices). Spoiler alert: Hermès could produce more Birkin bags and yet decides not to. The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3556882/The-bag-not-allowed-buy-covetable-snooty-stores-sell-list-happened-sent-ordinary-women-ask-Hermes-handbag.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">choking of supply</a> adds heft to the narrative that this is a special bag, and it adds credibility to the urgency — you may be shit out of luck next week if you don&#39;t plunk down $14,000 now.</p><p> Snap Inc. stock began trading yesterday, and bankers did a masterful job of manufacturing scarcity. The triple threat of social/video/millennial is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/should-you-buy-snapchats-ipo-pros-and-cons-2017-3" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">uber-fashionable</a> , and the underwriters ensured that, after placing the bulk of shares with institutions, which implicitly commit to holding for a long(ish) time, the bankers let only 14% of the shares float (be available for trade).</p><p> So, even if a Birkin bag or Snap shares are not intrinsically worth $14,000 or $25/share, if scarcity supports the price then God bless them, no? No. <a href="https://time.com/4182246/hermes-birkin-bag-investment-gold/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Hermès can maintain scarcity</a> . However, over the next 24 months, seven times the number of Snap shares could hit the market. The network&#39;s artisanship/specialness is also about to become less scarce as Instagram Stories continues counterfeiting the “Snap bag.” I believe, in 2018, Snap shareholders will discover they don&#39;t own <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-live-updates-snap-ipo-2017-htmlstory.html#snap-inc-shares-close-up-44" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">a Birkin</a> , not even a Kors or a Kate Spade, but an Esprit Black Brown Round Barrel Bag Purse Shoulder Small Hipster.</p><h4> Object Orientation</h4><p> We&#39;ve been reading words for several hundred years, listening to words for thousands, and learning from images for millions. We, as a species, are great with images. We can interpret/absorb an image <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bF9PF0Yvjs&amp;t=43s" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">50 times faster</a> than words, as we&#39;ve had a lot more practice with visuals. Just as music is cemented into our being in our late teens, the images of our early childhood become fixed into our gray matter.</p><p> When I was 7 we lived in a house near the beach in Laguna Niguel. My dad would come home early (he was a salesman), and we&#39;d go bodysurfing and see seals and porpoises just offshore. When there was a storm, we&#39;d go to Newport Beach. From the end of the pier we&#39;d look several hundred feet out and alert each other when millions of gallons, barreling toward shore, morphed into a blue-gray hemi cylinder 8, maybe 10 feet high and wait for the pier to vibrate, even shake, as the rising sea floor thrust the cylinder up and the wave crashed down on the water.</p><p> On one of four consecutive nights, beginning on the full and new moons in spring, my mom would wake me at midnight, and, armed with flashlights, we&#39;d go down to the beach and watch what looked like hot slices of metal dancing in the shallow surf. <a href="https://www.californiabeaches.com/grunion-run-schedule/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">The grunion</a> were running.</p><p> They weren&#39;t all images from the title sequence of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9cCMr1nYcA" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">The OC</a></em> I remember, on TV, a skinny guy wearing a ski mask on a hotel balcony interrupting awe-inspiring performances from Mark Spitz and Olga Korbut. The only reason it stuck is every time this guy came on screen, my parents stood in front of the TV, visibly uncomfortable.</p><p> When my father was going on a business trip, my mom and I would go with him to Orange County Airport. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/nostalgia-travel/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">More than an airport</a> , it felt like a restaurant where people pulled up, in the back, in commercial aircraft. There was a bar with a wraparound balcony on the second floor that you could access via stairs from the street. No security. My dad would take me out on the balcony and cover my ears as aircraft engines screamed in anticipation of the pilot releasing the brakes and beginning the 5,700-foot transformation from beached seal to soaring eagle.</p><p> He taught me the difference between a 727 and a DC-9 (three jets vs. two), and between the DC-10 and the L10-11 (third jet is part of the fuselage vs. finding residence halfway up the tail). The backyard of this restaurant was dominated by two brands, Air California and Pacific Southwest Airlines. Pacific planes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines#/media/File:Pacific_Southwest_Airlines_L-1011_N10114_1.jpg" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">had a smile</a> painted on the nose, grinning at us through the big windows. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215191" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/airplaine-illu-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> My parents were living the American Dream. Two immigrants with an 8th-grade education, they applied hard work and talent to the greatest force of good in history, the US economy. We lived close to the beach. But they (mostly my dad) fucked up, and soon we were living in two houses, neither near the beach. After the divorce, my dad would pick me up after work every other Friday in his Gran Torino, from our 800-square-foot apartment in Encino. I had to wait outside, sometimes for an hour, far from our apartment, because my mom didn&#39;t want to risk seeing my dad, or even his car, as she hated him. I became skilled at identifying cars, from a distance, by the shape and luminosity of their headlights. <a href="https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0OTYxNTEzMjczMTA4MTM4/facts-about-the-pacer-car.jpg" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">AMC Pacers</a> were easiest.</p><p> Anytime I hear sound in the air, I still look up, and, most of the time, I can identify the plane and airline. Last weekend, in South Beach, my friends pretended to be impressed with my ability to distinguish the A-380 headed to Munich (Lufthansa) from the double-decker Airbus flying to Paris (Air France). Gazing upward and cataloging air traffic is an instinct for me — look up, identify an object, and think of when we were a family and lived near the beach.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS I&#39;ll be back on Monday with a fresh look at the Markets on the <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/ProfGPod?sid=web" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Pod</a> .</p><p> PPS Watch my five-minute <a href="https://www.sectionschool.com/courses/the-brand-strategy-sprint?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=nmnm&amp;utm_campaign=brandcasestudy&amp;utm_content=0413#course-case-study" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">lecture on scarcity</a> here.什么。 A.

Phew … that was exciting.</p><p> Anyway, I&#39;m in Tokyo this week with my boys. We&#39;re doing a series of activities I don&#39;t enjoy but know will age well. Venturing to the Imperial Palace is torturous. However, as we&#39;re leaving I begin to enjoy it. Like serving in the Marines, I&#39;ll be glad I “did” it. (Note: I did not serve.) We take a mess of pictures, and the only tangible benefit from AI I&#39;ve registered, other than the next episode of <em>The Last of Us</em> starting in 3 … 2 … 1, is the Apple Memories feature, which strings together photos with cheesy music in the background. At the “end,” I plan to indulge in a shit-ton of heroin and watch these memories over and over. Pretty sure my deathbed scene is what Tim Cook had in mind when he greenlit the product. Also, the third leg of my exit stool will be a nurse with soft, loving hands … but that&#39;s another post.</p><p> As it&#39;s Thursday night and Tokyo Tower (don&#39;t ask) and Yakitori are waiting, we&#39;re going to highlight some of our favorite Office Hours questions. These queries focus on parenting, AI, and optimism.</p><p> <strong>Q.</strong> <strong>Hi, Prof G. My name is Ben, and I&#39;m from Oakland, California. My question focuses on something you talk honestly about, fatherhood. My wife and I are expecting our first child next month. We&#39;re both very excited and slightly terrified but looking forward to our new titles of parents. My question is: If you could do it all over again from the beginning, what would you do differently in regard to raising children, and what would you double down on?</strong></p><p> A. Congratulations. One thing I would not do is be in the delivery room again. I found it disturbing and gross — they were more worried about me than her. I was so nauseated, I couldn&#39;t stand. I don&#39;t buy that men should be in the delivery room. I know, primitive. Sue me. Anyways … a few things you might feel:</p><p> First, I was worried I didn&#39;t have enough money. I hadn&#39;t been good at relationships and was worried that if I fucked up this one it would have an exponentially bigger impact. Specifically, I was now responsible for a kid, and it freaked me out — I think that&#39;s natural. In many ways it was motivating and productive. My economic security has grown exponentially since the birth of my oldest. Was that a function of focus, or a raging bull market? The answer is yes.</p><p> I did not love this thing when it first showed up. People claim you&#39;re instantly in love. I fell in love with my boys over time — but when the first one arrived, it felt similar to a science experiment. My job was to keep the thing alive, and the upside wasn&#39;t readily apparent. If you hear angels singing and see bright lights, great.如果没有，请不要担心。 It comes.</p><p> Your main job is to be supportive of your wife/partner. In the very early days, women are more important to the kid — you&#39;re mostly useless. We pretend it&#39;s fun the first year. It&#39;s not, and dad doesn&#39;t play a big role. Your job is to show up, do night feedings, make sure your wife gets some sleep and keeps her sanity, and do what you can to make the home feel secure and your wife loved. Be a ballast — a steadying force, focused, and disciplined/adult about money to avoid that stress infecting the household. Also, just be there.</p><p> If you have the flexibility and resources, I would have a second one sooner rather than later. Having two felt three or four times better than one. One is too much pressure/focus — on you and the kid. I was an only child and believe I missed a lot. The negotiation, arguments, balance, positive tension — the joy/stress/noise/motion two kids bring to a household feels like the difference between having an accessory and a family. I&#39;m glad we did two. I wish we&#39;d had another, but I was worried about money and felt we were pushing our luck. It&#39;s a challenging world for kids, and I felt we should cash out with two wonderful boys. Looking back, I wish we&#39;d had a daughter, but it wasn&#39;t in the cards.</p><p> There is an arc to happiness. Across every culture, happiness looks like a smile — youth is (mostly) about <em>Star Wars</em> , football, and discovering limits with friends. And … slowly, then suddenly, you get less happy, as kids and careers are stressful. The realization you&#39;re not going to be a senator or have a fragrance named after you is a bummer. Generally speaking, people are their least happy from the ages of 25 to 45. So, if you feel stressed, unhappy even, recognize you&#39;re tracking — that&#39;s part of the journey. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215184" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/happiness-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> The only thing in my life that&#39;s more important to me than me (I&#39;m selfish) are my kids. It&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;re having a child. Before kids, for me, there was never enough … I was always hungry for more. More money, more fabulous experiences, more relationships, more impressive people, more relevance … more. There are moments with my sons when, for the first time, I think, “This is it, I&#39;m good.”</p><p> Having a kid is also the ultimate expression of optimism and commitment to your partner: Whether you like it or not, you&#39;re committing to stay in each other&#39;s lives for 18-plus years. Keep in mind, your relationship with their mother/father will be the reference for how they will likely treat their adult partners. See above: Be there.</p><p> In sum, having kids was the best thing I&#39;ve done that ruined my life.</p><p> <strong>Q. Hi, Prof G. This is Paul from Chicago. Here&#39;s a thought: Could ChatGPT save us from social media and political rhetoric that&#39;s become unencumbered by facts? It doesn&#39;t seem like a technical stretch to deploy ChatGPT as a real-time fact-checker for social media posts. Perhaps instead of a blue check, Elon&#39;s engineers could work on a Pinocchio icon whose nose length correlates with an AI accuracy test for each tweet. Is this a practical application of AI or a pipe dream?</strong></p><p> A. A few stats: Fact-checking organizations <em>are</em> building AI-driven tools to help deal with the proliferation of online misinformation. This is a huge problem: 80% of US adults say they&#39;ve consumed fake news, and 38% say they&#39;ve accidentally shared it. But in 2020, Newtral, the biggest fact-checking team in the EU, developed a multilingual AI language model called the Claim Hunter. The developers use thousands of statements to train the system to identify claims from social media accounts and political figures — which accelerates the fact-checking process. The AI only flags statements that aren&#39;t questions or opinions for the fact-checkers to review, cutting the time fact-checking takes by 70% to 80%. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215183" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1180" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02-300x184.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02-520x320.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02-768x472.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02-1536x944.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/double-donut-chart-02-1200x738.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> There&#39;s now a lot of data demonstrating AI&#39;s flaws, its tendency to generate misinformation. In January, researchers tested ChatGPT&#39;s accuracy by giving it a hundred prompts relating to common false narratives around US politics and health care. ChatGPT produced false information in <em>80% of its responses</em> .</p><p> So far, the majority of data shows that ChatGPT will likely be weaponized — at least in the short run — to spread misinformation. You can tell ChatGPT, “Give me 15 statements written in the style of the CDC that say mRNA vaccines alter your DNA,” and the large language model will produce 15 snackable, tweetable, Instagrammable statements that feel real and are false.</p><p> The problem is incentives. Currently, the incentives are to grab attention and find things that will get circulated. And, unfortunately, our species is drawn to the novel and to catastrophe. You&#39;ll have AI-driven fact-checking, but I wonder if the people incentivized to spread misinformation will get out in front, while platforms look the other way. Because ultimately, saying mRNA vaccines alter your DNA will result in more engagement, more clicks, and more Nissan ads. The most optimistic thing about the development of AI, in my view, is that (so far) it&#39;s subscription- vs. advertising-based, meaning the incentives are to add value to the consumer, instead of the advertiser.</p><p> If I could make just one prediction about AI: AI won&#39;t take your job. Someone using AI will.</p><p> <strong>Q. Hey, Scott, this is Robin, calling from Copenhagen. I was chief marketing officer of WeWork and am a big fan of your show. There&#39;s a lot of things to be worried about in the world right now, and you frequently rant about them, and I love it. But what are you hopeful about?</strong></p><p> A. You&#39;re right, we&#39;re more cynical than we should be for a lot of reasons. One of them is the media, which needs to justify <em>The Situation Room</em> and constant news alerts pushed to your mobile. The media knows we are like a Tyrannosaurus rex — drawn to movement and violence. Much of it is cadence. News is a profit machine trying to capture and retain attention. However, if you pull the lens back and take a global perspective, it&#39;s difficult to argue things haven&#39;t improved. What headline doesn&#39;t work? A: “Things Marginally Better Today.”</p><p> I teach big classes at Stern — around 300 young adults, average age 27. Every year they get smarter, faster, more socially conscious, and more facile with technology. We are producing people who will do a better job running things. An emerging generation of thoughtful, talented leaders, coupled with recently passed climate legislation, should reduce America&#39;s carbon emissions by 40% in about a decade. Still a lot of work to be done, but progress. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215182" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart.png" alt="" width="960" height="550" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/line-chart-768x440.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p><p> Also, more people (globally) are <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/happiness-benevolence-and-trust-during-covid-19-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending time</a> helping someone they will never meet than ever before. People are planting more trees the shade of which they will never sit under. That is how societies grow great.</p><p> Finally, led by America, the West&#39;s support of the brave people of Ukraine is an important moment we&#39;ll look back on with pride. NATO has emerged from a brain coma and acquired new members, Europe is a Union again, and we have destroyed half of Russia&#39;s kinetic power. We are showing the world that when democracies join hands they are an insurmountable force. Murderous autocrats are watching — and sleeping less well.</p><h4> Tokyo Nights</h4><p> As I write this, I&#39;m staring at the Tokyo Tower from the 31st floor of an American hotel (The Edition) while drinking German beer. Tokyo is an amazing city, and Japanese culture defines the term “grace.” I woke up with a stiff neck this morning, so I walked to a wellness clinic where an acupuncturist used his iPhone&#39;s translate feature to discern what was bothering me. My boys fell asleep watching <em>Ted Lasso</em> , so I crept to the hotel bar. I&#39;m two drinks in and feel overwhelmed by what seems like an obvious, irrefutable truth: Our children will have wonderful lives. They and their generation will face huge problems, as we did. And, like their ancestors, they will address them with unprecedented character, skills, and tools we can&#39;t even imagine today. Despite the catastrophizing and nihilism of media and tech leaders, respectively, the West&#39;s prosperity will be similar to that of the market: a coin flip every day, but over the decades … up and to the right. On the same day this week, young people (en masse) protested state houses over gun control, Finland joined NATO, and my 12-year-old son purposefully left his phone at the hotel, saying he&#39;d “had too much screen time this week.” I should come to Japan every month.</p><p>人生はとても豊かです, <br /><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS If you want to submit your own Office Hours question, send a voice recording to: <a href="mailto:officehours@profgmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officehours@profgmedia.com</a></p><p> PPS Speaking of ChatGPT: What happens when you put it into a two-week, MBA-level Section sprint and ask it to write a positioning strategy? <a href="https://www.sectionschool.com/blog/can-chatgpt-write-a-positioning-strategy-2?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=nmnm&amp;utm_campaign=ChatGPT&amp;utm_content=0407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find out here.</a></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.profgalloway.com/office-hours/">Office Hours</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.profgalloway.com">No Mercy / No Malice</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.profgalloway.com/office-hours/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 24</slash:comments></item><item><title> Fame</title><link/> https://www.profgalloway.com/fame/<comments> https://www.profgalloway.com/fame/#comments</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Galloway]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:25:58 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.profgalloway.com/?p=215173 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Until my forties, I was known … but not famous.

Known in grad school at Berkeley, known in the e-commerce scene in the Bay Area, and, after having taught 5,000 students, known around NYU&#39;s campus. Day 1 of “fame” came in 2016. The team at L2 (my business intelligence firm) was headed to our weekly team lunch when, from across the street, we heard: “Prof G … we love your videos!” Two Indian men in their twenties hurriedly crossed the street to tell me they never missed our “Winners &amp; Losers” videos and that I had a following in India. Then they asked for a selfie. The whole team thought it was odd and amusing that people from several thousand miles away not only knew our work, but also that the work inspired affection and admiration.</p><p> Every day since then, it&#39;s grown. Messengers swerve onto the sidewalk and high-five me. Women, visiting from Michigan, run out of restaurants to ask if I can wait a minute while they get their (horrified) son to take a selfie with me: “We listen to your pod together.” And today, I&#39;ll receive dozens of emails and hundreds of comments from people I&#39;ve never met or been in the same room with. Fame. Fred Allen said a celebrity is someone who works hard to become well known, then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized. I have never donned dark glasses as … I love being recognized. I can&#39;t think of a time when it didn&#39;t make me feel good, even if I was in a hurry. It has, no joke, made me feel better about the world, and myself — people are so wonderful to me, and (almost) convince me we&#39;re having an impact.</p><p> The real joy is people recognizing me when I&#39;m with my kids or friends. Years ago, whenever anything good happened, I would call my mom and tell her first. She was inevitably more excited about my first mortgage or dog than I would ever be. The audible joy on the other end of the line made the achievement and the moment real. Even though she&#39;s gone, my first instinct whenever anything good happens is still to call her. To make that good thing real. But she&#39;s not around, so many great things feel as if they aren&#39;t real, as if they didn&#39;t really happen. People recognizing me, saying something nice, makes some of the nicer things in my life feel (once again) as if they actually happened. If I sound a bit fucked up, trust your instincts.</p><p> There is a dark lining to the silver cloud — one I try not to dwell on. I read recently that for every person who comes up to a celebrity and says something, 50 other people recognize the person but don&#39;t approach. In crowded cities and locations, someone might say hi to me every 20 minutes. That converts to 150 additional people an hour who see me, though I don&#39;t see them. The panopticon of fame. I understand why truly famous, A-list people feel they can&#39;t leave the house.</p><p> Still, the saving grace is that, in person, people are wonderful. Online, they&#39;re significantly less wonderful. A non-zero percentage of online recognition is really ugly. The inevitable corollary of success is that people feel the need to take you down, and online media has tapped into that instinct like nothing else. There seems to be a cottage industry for correcting or calling people out once they have (any) fame. I&#39;d like to say it just rolls off of me, but it doesn&#39;t. Some of it is just downright disturbing. Recently, I&#39;ve been receiving emails from (purportedly) young men experiencing suicidal ideation who need help (ie, money). Not just “a Nigerian prince needs your help” — these are closely tailored to my publicly stated views and concerns. They&#39;re clearly fakes (possibly AI-generated), but still … disturbing. Fame has validated for me what almost every study shows: Anything that happens in real life is profoundly better, kinder, and more human than its online facsimile.</p><h4> Innate</h4><p> Fame is increasingly embedded in our economy and daily lives and thus garnering more research attention. One finding: it&#39;s about our fear of death. Empirical studies confirm that our desire for fame <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298860802391546?needAccess=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases</a> with greater awareness of our mortality. Which makes sense: The only thing that can outlive your body is the memory of you.</p><p> That drive can inspire great achievements. Charles Dickens was famously <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/charles-dickens-and-fame-vs-celebrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obsessed</a> with fame — and that obsession coursed through his characters. Ovid admitted his mission was for his “fame to live to eternity.” Some people, though, try to skip over the “great achievement” part. As Harry &amp; Meghan subject us to their worldwide privacy tour, we&#39;re not as much interested in them — both brighten up a room by leaving it — but in the hypocrisy of pursuing privacy on Instagram and Netflix. (Q: Is it wrong to wish they could be mowed down by a psychotic skier who makes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vagina-scented candles</a> ?) Or maybe they wish for a more modern approach to fame: <em>I hate fame. Look at me. Please. See how much I hate it? Look at me</em> .</p><p> Regardless, these people know we only truly die when people stop knowing who we are.</p><h4> Who</h4><p> Despite what Instagram and the <em>Daily Mail</em> indicate, becoming famous is not most people&#39;s No. 1 priority. In fact, only 1 in 10 Americans admit that fame is important to them. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215175" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02.png" alt="" width="1920" height="950" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02-300x148.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02-520x257.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02-768x380.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02-1536x760.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/figure-chart-02-1200x594.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> Who are the 10% who want to be famous? <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19646329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambitious, attention-seeking, conceited, and psychologically vulnerable</a> folks. Psychologically vulnerable, meaning they feel they have issues that fame will help them overcome. The other term for this is low self-esteem. I just read the previous paragraph and … feel seen.</p><p> This may explain why young people are especially interested in fame. Compared to 2% of boomers, more than a third of 18- to 24-year-olds say fame is important to them. Becoming a celebrity is akin to sitting at the cool kid&#39;s table. It&#39;s the “ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/health/psychology/22fame.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect balm for the sting of social exclusion.</a> ” The social media cocktail stirs into this follower counts and like buttons, escalating young people&#39;s emotional tumult to dangerous levels. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215174" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1120" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1-300x175.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1-520x303.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1-768x448.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1-1536x896.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1-1200x700.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Externalities</h4><p> If fame is a treatment for feeling inadequate, it&#39;s likely not a good one. It turns out fame, <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like power</a> , is an addictive substance. Many famous people report feeling fearful they&#39;ll lose their notoriety — and when they do, the transition out of the public eye creates a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233667622_Being_a_Celebrity_A_Phenomenology_of_Fame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychological burden</a> . As with heroin, getting hooked is the easy part. Actors, singers, musicians, and athletes on average <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">die younger</a> . The upside? They cement their fame. Neither James Dean nor Marilyn Monroe was that talented. Kurt Cobain would still be famous. But I digress.</p><p> Fame is a drug increasingly laced with the fentanyl of fame itself. Almost any position or attribute is a positive if you can be famous for it. Whether it&#39;s homemade porn, catastrophizing on Twitter, or mocking the disabled, if it makes news you&#39;ve won. And in an attention economy you can monetize that. The wheel spins. BTW, it&#39;s the dealer who wins. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215177" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1120" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post-300x175.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post-520x303.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post-768x448.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post-1536x896.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instagram-post-1200x700.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Goldilocks</h4><p> I have just the right amount of fame. On a regular basis, someone approaches me and says something nice about our work, and it&#39;s rewarding. At the same time, I can eat at a restaurant bar alone and feel (mostly) anonymous. Knowing that some people likely do recognize me triggers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawthorne effect</a> — I am now more conscious of my actions, as I assume I am being observed. Probably a good thing.</p><p> I&#39;m a high functioning fame-aholic. I love alcohol and THC but am not addicted. Neither gets in the way of my life, and I don&#39;t crave them. I am, however, addicted to the affirmation of strangers. I hope that makes me more like Dickens, less like a Windsor. I&#39;ve accepted I&#39;ll never be a serious scholar, because as Zhuangzi noted, “He who pursues fame at the risk of losing himself is not a scholar.” I don&#39;t do peer-reviewed research as (almost) nobody reads it. But I believe the work we do makes a difference in other ways.</p><p> The allure of fame takes some people to dark places, so it matters where the void that people try and fill with fame comes from. For me, I believe the void is that, growing up, I was invisible. Not a good or bad student, neither a loner nor especially social, athletic but not talented, funny but not hilarious. At big public schools it was pretty easy to blend into the ecosystem as a defense mechanism against predators who were more popular, mean, or even violent. An especially bad acne week? Rejection from a person/group beyond my social reach? No problem, just retreat and go invisible.</p><p> Our research on struggling young men largely distills to one determining factor: The presence, or lack thereof, of a male role model. I had one — my handsome, sharp-witted dad was the most impressive man I knew — but he moved away when I was 8 and (often) didn&#39;t seem that interested in me. And why would he be? I was barely there. And if my dad didn&#39;t see me, why would anybody else?</p><p> So my limited fame fills a hole, an old fear that I&#39;d never amount to anything, I&#39;d remain invisible and … alone. The hole leaks, though, so it never fills up. Recognition from strangers, as you age, feels increasingly like empty calories. The affection people have for you is for your public representative … it&#39;s not really for you — they don&#39;t know you. And if they did, they&#39;d likely be disappointed. I believe the last sentence illustrates what people call impostor&#39;s syndrome.</p><h4> 15:15</h4><p> I&#39;m 15 seconds past my 15 minutes and still trying to determine how — regardless what demons inspired my pursuit of fame — to turn chicken shit into chicken salad. So we highlight the work of other academics; catalyze the conversation on important issues; help people feel more connected to each other and the country; and (most important) call attention to others&#39; achievements. Fame, like compassion, is not a zero-sum game. It&#39;s so easy to share and means so much to people.</p><p> Fame and atheism go well together because the only thing that survives death is living people&#39;s memory of you and if/how it influences their actions. In 50 years, I&#39;ll be gone. When I think about that (which is often) I am reminded that I don&#39;t need the recognition of strangers to make me immortal. There are two men who&#39;ll then be 62 and 65, who lived with me the first 18-plus years of their life, who will remember me. They&#39;ll remember how intense, yet goofy, I was. I&#39;d also like to believe they&#39;ll be more kind and secure than I was, as, every day, their father confirmed they were wonderful and immensely loved.

The book is set in a dystopian United States on the brink of economic collapse. Exhausted by a corrupt government, the hero, John Galt, packs his things and starts a self-sufficient community in an isolated valley, hidden — and separate — from the US He recruits the nation&#39;s business leaders to quit their jobs and populate his utopia.</p><p> The book was a hit, especially among disaffected people who felt the US was on the wrong track. Sales spike whenever America experiences a downturn. In 2009, following the Great Financial Crisis, <a href="https://ari.aynrand.org/press-releases/atlas-shrugged-sets-a-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half a million</a> copies were sold. Ayn Rand&#39;s message: Government is rigged, America is broken, and you should quit. She eventually became a conservative icon, and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> , the quitter&#39;s bible.</p><h4> Options</h4><p> Quitting used to mean being anti-government. But social media has morphed the message into something larger. There are now multiple ways to quit — and multiple gurus, communities, and schools of thought to guide you.</p><p> Libertarianism is one path: an entire political party dedicated to going it alone. Or you can take more extreme measures. One Republican representative recently suggested a <a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1627665203398688768?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“national divorce.”</a> That we quit on this whole “United” States thing and split the country across political lines. Some of our most influential media personalities <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/sean-hannity-endorses-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-call-banning-people-who-move-blue-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> the idea, and an increasing share of Americans are <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/new-initiative-explores-deep-persistent-divides-between-biden-and-trump-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flirting with it</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215166" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ppl-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> Others are resigned to all-out apocalypse. Four in 10 Americans are either actively prepping for a Doomsday scenario or have plans to. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, that number is 6 in 10. For tech billionaires, the quitting menu is more expansive. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, bought a 477-acre bunker in New Zealand in preparation for a US apocalypse, and was given citizenship after spending 12 days in the country. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a pact</a> with Thiel that they&#39;d fly to New Zealand together when the collapse arrives. If that falls through, Sam will be fine: “I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Forces, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.” This is what it means to quit — on the eve of the apocalypse, load up the Gulfstream with guns, and leave. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215163" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1389" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-300x217.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-520x376.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-768x556.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1536x1111.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bar-chart-1200x868.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Technostate</h4><p> When did things get so extreme? How did we go from anti-government Reaganism to apocalyptic secessionism? The movement has roots in the Valley.</p><p> In 2013 a former general partner of Andreessen Horowitz named Balaji Srinivasan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave a talk</a> at Y-Combinator, the nation&#39;s premier accelerator for tech startups. The talk was titled “Silicon Valley&#39;s Ultimate Exit.” Srinivasan opened with a question: “Is the United States the Microsoft of nations?” The thesis was the US had become outdated, brittle, and slow. He offered two solutions. “You can try to reform” — change the system from within — or, his preferred option: “You can leave.”</p><p> In Balaji&#39;s view, this was Silicon Valley&#39;s destiny: to secede from the US and form a techno-utopian state, free from government regulation and any duty to serve the needs and interests of the rest of the country — the “ultimate exit.” It was also, he divulged, the dream of many other prominent tech leaders. Balaji cited Larry Page&#39;s interest in “setting aside a part of the world” for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4334356/larry-page-wants-to-set-aside-a-part-of-the-world-for-experimentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unregulated experimentation</a> , Marc Andreessen&#39;s <a href="https://laptrinhx.com/marc-andreessen-the-world-is-going-to-see-an-explosion-of-countries-in-the-years-ahead-747372622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prediction</a> that the world would see “an explosion of countries in the years ahead,” and, of course, Elon&#39;s mission to <a href="https://www.space.com/18596-mars-colony-spacex-elon-musk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colonize Mars</a> .</p><p> Balaji predicted that when that time comes, there will be pushback from the “Paper Belt,” a term used to describe America&#39;s less technologically advanced cities — DC, New York, Boston, and so on. But he believed Silicon Valley would persevere. “We&#39;re putting a horse head in all of their beds,” he said. “We&#39;re becoming stronger than all of them combined.” Technology would be the tool that would let the elite secede from the union without having to pick up a gun.</p><p> The speech was an enormous hit, and a precursor to a movement among Valley elite to begin seceding from America via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769731/elon-musk-billionaire-tax-stock-sell-off-ron-wyden-tweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shitposting</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2012/12/12/progridlock-better-than-government-meddling-andreessen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government</a> , <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/tech/peter-thiel-facebook-exit-gop-politics/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financing</a> MAGA campaigns, catastrophizing on <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2023/03/15/david_sacks_biden_yellen_and_powell_called_inflation_transitory_so_they_could_keep_spending_more_money.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1634792355294515200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> , and demonstrating a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821532/elon-musk-biden-infrastructure-government-subsidies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general disdain</a> for our country. Several tech startups have emerged dedicated to the secessionist dream. <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Seasteading Institute</a> , co-founded by Thiel and Milton Friedman&#39;s grandson, is building politically autonomous floating cities. <a href="https://prospera.hn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prospera</a> bought a plot of land on Honduras&#39;s Roatan Island where you can pay to be an “e-resident.” <a href="https://nation3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nation3</a> is working on an “online-first, zero-tax nation with its own jurisdiction, court, and system of law.” The list <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goes on</a> .</p><h4> Doomcoin</h4><p> It&#39;s no coincidence that the guy who feels Silicon Valley will secede is also pushing crypto. Last week, Balaji made headlines after he <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1636797265317867520%7Ctwgr%5E5ec40a78aed6d4eaee68b9c13e6ac54260a3053f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinjournal.net%2Fnews%2Fcoinbase-cto-bets-bitcoin-to-1m-in-90-days-but-im-not-sure-even-he-believes-it%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bet $1 million</a> that Bitcoin would reach $1 million within the next 90 days. Sort of. The real wager is that the US will enter a period of “hyperinflation” within 90 days — his proxy for that scenario is Bitcoin breaching $1 million. Consider what that means: In his view, the price of Bitcoin is directly proportional to the likelihood that America will experience a catastrophe. Put another way, he&#39;s long Doomsday … via Bitcoin.</p><p> People have capitalized on catastrophes before — political coups, short selling, etc. — but in the history of humanity, there&#39;s never been an asset class whose value is <em>predicated</em> on collapse. Bitcoin has risen 30% since Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s crisis threatened the banking system. The cryptocurrency has historically been marketed as a “hedge against inflation,” but it&#39;s really a hedge against catastrophe. Which is to say, a bet <em>on</em> catastrophe. Crypto is becoming the ultimate libertarian scheme — the world&#39;s first asset class that encourages you to stop investing in America, and quit. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215164" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitcoin-02.png" alt="" width="960" height="550" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitcoin-02.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitcoin-02-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitcoin-02-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitcoin-02-768x440.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p><h4> The Dots</h4><p> Guns, bunkers, private islands, crypto, secession … connect the dots. The venture catastrophists now have a vested interest in the nation&#39;s decline. They&#39;ve invested too much in Doomsday not to root for it — maybe even catalyze it. Balaji has a million dollars on the line; Andreessen Horowitz has <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/announcement/crypto-fund-four/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>$8 billion</em></a> .</p><p> Much of their catastrophizing is in response to elements of US society that are legitimately broken. The first block of Bitcoin ever mined is encoded with a message that reads, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” — a reminder that Bitcoin was born in response to the failures of our banking system during the Great Financial Crisis. Post-Dodd-Frank, we still have issues. Silicon Valley Bank was mismanaged, and many banks are fragile. The government is gridlocked, parties polarized, teens depressed. There&#39;s a lot wrong with America, and we have reason to be upset about it.</p><p> The question is: What do we do about it? For too many, the answer is quit: Instead of fixing the Fed, start a different currency. Instead of healing our divides, split the nation in two. Instead of making this planet more habitable, colonize other planets or put a headset on that takes you to a meta (better) universe. But here&#39;s the thing: We&#39;re stuck here, and with each other.</p><h4> Reformers</h4><p> History&#39;s greatest leaders aren&#39;t quitters, but reformers. Abraham Lincoln felt it was his “duty to preserve the Union,” not to accept its division and cauterize the wound. Despite the headlines, and all the work to be done, our nation&#39;s arc still bends toward bringing groups together. From Civil Rights to gay marriage, America still strives to bring people closer under the auspices of a shared belief in a union that offers liberty and the pursuit of happines. We have lost sight of our achievements. The US is responsible for more than half of the world&#39;s Nobel science laureates and has provided more than a trillion dollars in non-military foreign aid. Inflation is high, but <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/inflation-rate-?continent=g20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as high</a> as our developed peers, and our economy <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues</a> to grow. We can and will be the first society in history to be a truly multicultural democracy. It comes down to this: Do we invest in Mars or Michigan? Are our most fortunate business and elected leaders citizens or survivalists?</p><p> When I was in elementary school, we performed Duck and Cover drills to prepare for a nuclear attack by the Russians. A flash of light from the detonation of a thermonuclear device? No problem, just duck and cover, and you&#39;ll be fine. Spoiler alert: No matter how many rough-cut gems you can shove up your ass or how plush your bunker, there is no escaping the fallout of our democracies failing. Because our democracies are largely capitalist and accept, if not idolize, people who aggregate the wealth of small nations. If shit gets real — I mean real — bunkers will likely become easy targets in the recalibration of society. The previous sentence is a pedantic way of saying the best bet (by far) is to double down on a society that already has Netflix, Nespresso, and Girl Scouts. Citizenship is not just an obligation; it&#39;s also a trade. In the case of America, the best trade is to invest in each other and what MLK called our “beloved community.” We need reformers, not quitters.</p><h4> Villagers</h4><p> The 2003 M. Night Shyamalan film <em>The Village</em> is about a group of people who secede and develop an alliance with creatures who keep villagers in line by terrorizing them. Spoiler alert: The creatures are just villagers in costume. The threat is still real, but it&#39;s exaggerated in order to serve powerful people&#39;s objectives. In the US, our threats are also real, but powerful people are dressing them up to suit their own nihilism and self-interest. These anti-citizens do not see dead people (a much better film), but tear at the fabric of what is, and continues to be, the great experiment that is the US They should be called out for what they are: cowards.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/ProfGPod?sid=newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last week on the Prof G Pod</a> , I spoke with Bill Burnett, co-author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller “ <em>Designing Your Life</em> ” and co-director of the Life Design Lab at Stanford University.
