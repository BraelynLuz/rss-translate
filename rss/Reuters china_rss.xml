It borders Serbia to the north and east, North Macedonia to the southeast, Albania the southwest and Montenegro the west.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;CAPITAL: Pristina.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;LANGUAGE: Albanian and Serbian are official languages.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;RELIGION: Around 90% - largely ethnic Albanians - are Muslims. The other significant denominations are Orthodox Christians - mainly Serbs - and Roman Catholics.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT: A parliamentary democracy with a 120-seat legislature, including 10 seats reserved for Serbs and 10 for other minorities. Government is headed by the prime minister, with the president in a ceremonial role.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;ECONOMY: Landlocked and poor, Kosovo hopes its mineral wealth will eventually unlock the foreign investment it needs to tackle unemployment of around 30%.但许多投资者对动荡的种族紧张局势望而却步。 Corruption, smuggling and organised crime are other serious problems stunting development and undermining Kosovo&#39;s aspiration to EU membership.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;HISTORY &amp; PEOPLE: Kosovo became part of the Kingdom of Serbia in the early 13th century, with a mixed population of ethnic Albanians, Serbs and Vlachs. The Nemanjic dynasty made Kosovo the spiritual heartland of Serbia, giving lands to the Orthodox Church and building monasteries that still stand today.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many Serbs left over the five centuries after the Ottoman Empire defeated Serbs under Prince Lazar in the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, while ethnic Albanians grew in number. Mutual expulsions and migrations to and from neighbouring Albania in the early 20th century changed Kosovo&#39;s ethnic makeup.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;VIOLENCE &amp; WAR: Ethnic tensions escalated in the 1980s as federal, multinational Yugoslavia began to crumble and economic conditions deteriorated.民粹主义煽动者斯洛博丹·米洛舍维奇 (Slobodan Milosevic) 煽动塞尔维亚民族主义，将其作为 1989 年塞尔维亚当选总统的跳板，并取消了科索沃的省级自治。 He accused Kosovo Albanians of persecuting local Serbs and restricted their rights in education and local government.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After years of passive Kosovar resistance to Belgrade, an armed uprising flared in the late 1990s led by Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas, prompting a brutal crackdown by the Serbian-led Yugoslav federal army and Serbian security police.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Western powers warned Milosevic they would not tolerate another wave of Balkan &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; after wars in Bosnia and Croatia. Peace talks in France failed and in March 1999 NATO began bombing Serbia to force it to withdraw from Kosovo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some 800,000 Albanians fled or were expelled to Macedonia and Albania before Milosevic gave in, 78 days later. As his forces pulled out and NATO took over, UN agencies said up to 200,000 Serbs and other ethnic minorities left as well.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;FROM LIMBO TO INDEPENDENCE: After almost a decade under transitional UN administration, backed by tens of thousands of NATO peacekeeping troops, Kosovo declared independence in February 2008. Its statehood has been recognised by over 100 UN member states, including the United States and 22 EU countries, but not Serbia, its big power ally Russia, or China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Serbia has vowed never to recognise Kosovo&#39;s independence.它支持科索沃北部的民族主义少数民族塞族人抵制国家，造成事实上的分裂。 Half of local Serbs, or around 50,000, live in other parts of Kosovo and have become integrated into its political and economic life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In July 2010, the International Court of Justice ruled in an advisory opinion that Kosovo&#39;s declaration of independence had not violated general international law.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Belgrade and Kosovo have since engaged in years of sporadic, inconclusive talks on normalisation brokered by the European Union, but with no breakthrough to date. The stand-off in north Kosovo has been marked by repeated violent confrontations over the years, with Serbs erecting barricades and clashing with Pristina police trying in vain to impose state authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;figure>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VFWLQO7OGZKBVNNBVEMBGG6P6A.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Polish Kosovo Force (KFOR) soldiers guard a municipal office in Zvecan&quot;>; &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;i>;A man walks by Polish Kosovo Force (KFOR) soldiers standing guard at a municipal office in Zvecan, Kosovo May 30, 2023.

its first military spy satellite and leader Kim Jong Un has approved final preparations for the launch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It would be the North&#39;s latest step in a series of missile launches and weapons tests in recent months, including one of a new, solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tokyo expects North Korea to fire the rocket carrying its satellite over Japan&#39;s southwest island chain as it did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/why-north-koreas-satellite-launches-are-so-controversial-2022-03-07/&quot;>;2016&lt;/a>;, a defence ministry spokesperson said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Analysts say the new satellite is part of a surveillance technology programme that includes drones, aimed at improving the ability to strike targets in wartime.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;We will take destructive measures against ballistic and other missiles that are confirmed to land in our territory,&quot; Japan&#39;s defence ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Japan would use its Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) or Patriot Missile PAC-3 to destroy a North Korean missile, it added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Any North Korean missile launch would be a serious violation of UN Security Council resolutions condemning its nuclear and missile activity, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from launching,&quot; his office said on Twitter, adding it would co-operate with the US, South Korea and other countries and do all it could to collect and analyse information from any launch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A US State Department spokesperson said any North Korean launch that uses ballistic missile technology, including that which is used to put a satellite in orbit, would violate multiple UN resolutions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The US urges North Korea &quot;to refrain from further unlawful activity and calls on Pyongyang to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy,&quot; the spokesperson said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;South Korea joined in calling on the reclusive North to scrap its plan, which it described as &quot;illegal.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;If North Korea presses ahead, it will pay the price and suffer,&quot;

satellites, of which two appeared to have been successfully placed in orbit, the latest in 2016.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In May, its leader, Kim, inspected a military satellite facility, the KCNA state news agency said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korean-leader-orders-spy-satellite-launch-planned-kcna-2023-04-18/&quot;>;April&lt;/a>;, Japan sent to the East China Sea a destroyer carrying the SM-3 interceptors that can hit targets in space, and sent ground-based PAC-3 missiles, designed to strike warheads closer to the ground, to the Okinawan islands.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The government recognises that there is a possibility that the satellite may pass through our country&#39;s territory,&quot; Hirokazu Matsuno, the chief cabinet secretary, told a regular briefing after the North informed the Japanese coast guard of the plan.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;North Korean state media have criticised plans by Japan, South Korea and the United States to share real-time data on its missile launches, characterising the three as discussing &quot;sinister measures&quot;
